# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a prominent, stylistically consistent landing-page line indicating that print-on-demand service is available.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a single new information line reading “Print on demand available” (or equivalent correct English phrasing) in a prominent location on the landing page (e.g., within the hero text block or near the ordering call-to-action).
- Ensure the new line matches existing typography, colors, and spacing, and does not alter existing required text lines.

**User-visible outcome:** On initial page load, visitors can immediately see that print-on-demand is available, while all existing business title, founder line, and phone numbers remain unchanged.
