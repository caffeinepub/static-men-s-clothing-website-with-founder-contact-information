# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page static men’s clothing website that clearly presents the store title, founder info, and two clickable phone numbers (general contact and ordering) with a modern fashion-forward theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive single-page layout with the exact required English text: “Men’s Clothing Store”, “Founder: Yash Jaiswal”, “9919031636”, and “Order Now: 9919031626”.
- Make both phone numbers clickable via `tel:` links and visually label them as general contact vs ordering.
- Apply a coherent modern men’s fashion visual theme (avoid blue/purple as dominant colors), including consistent typography, spacing, and styled sections/callouts.
- Add and render generated static assets (logo + wide hero/banner) from `frontend/public/assets/generated` with no backend/image API.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a polished landing page for “Men’s Clothing Store”, see the founder and contact details, and tap either the general contact or order number to open their device dialer.
